/**
 * This Exception represents a JavaScript exception (available via getV8Exception)
 *
 * It is used for two purposes:
 *
 * 1) If an exception is encountered in actual JavaScript code that was called from Java,
 * the JavaScript exception is wrapped by an instance of this class which is then "rethrown".
 * In this case, the exception will contain the JavaScript stacktrace!
 *
 * 2) If Java code that is called by JavaScript wants to raise a specific kind of exception,
 * it can construct an instance of this class and throw it;
 * The contained exception is then unwrapped and "rethrown" in JavaScript
 *
 * Example 1)
 * Some JavaScript code called from Java tries to execute an unknown function "foo"
 * This will throw an instance of V8Exception "An exception was encountered in JavaScript", with an instance of
 * V8JSException referenced as `cause`. This cause in turn will contain the actual JavaScript exception:
 * ReferenceError: foo is not defined
 *
 * Example 2)
 * Some Java code called from JavaScript wants to throw an exception because a parameter is out of bounds.
 * To signal that to JavaScript, an instanceof "RangeError" should be thrown.
 * This is done by: new V8JSException(engine, "RangeError", "The parameter was out of bounds")
 * This will construct a new instance of RangeError, and throw that in JavaScript.
